# What's here?

This repository contains resource packs, mods, and more. I will make my own files, or I'll link another's.

# How do I download these files?

Its simple!
All you have to do is head over to the releases tab on the right and download the release of whatever file you were looking for. There will be a big blue link saying "Downlaod A Zip" or "Download A .jar file". The other way is to simply head to the main page and open the file. Then click "Download"

# Wanna download EVERYTHING?

If you want, you can bulk-download all the files. To do this, you need to head to releases > latest release > "Source Code (zip)".
